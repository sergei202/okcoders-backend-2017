### Git Bash

Windows does come with a built-in command prompt, but we will be using another Terminal emulator with built-in support for git, the version control software that works with GitHub. *Do not use the built-in command prompt*. Use Git Bash.

SSH Keys are used to establish a secure connection to GitHub and Heroku.

Follow the instructions at GitHub to create and register new SSH keys: [Generating SSH Keys for GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys).

Nice work! You just set up your development environment and are already using the command line! This is serious stuff!
